## About

> Vaporwave is both an aesthetic and genre of music that is meant to induce nostalgia, especially for the ’80s and early ’90s, and a longing for what we imagined the future would be like back in the 1980s. The driving theme behind vaporwave is that it makes you long for a future that never happened. Vaporwave music is often composed of samples of songs from the 1970s and 80s. - [Noa Ortiz](https://www.calibermag.net/blog/2021/3/1/the-inextricably-deep-world-of-vaporwave) 

**Vaporspace** is inspired by the idea of a scene portal. If vaporwave aesthetic represents a collective conscience, then each gif or image is like a portal or a snapshot of this retrofuturistic past. Each gif or image is a “memory”.
